\section{Introduction}
As this thesis is primarily an exploration of epitaxial interfaces using a wide array of experimental techniques, the background material here will cover the theoretical concepts that are regularly drawn upon to present the growth models presented elsewhere. Models presented later in the document are primarily of a conceptual nature and as such background here will also be presented in that manner.
