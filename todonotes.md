Writing ToDos
======================
* HRXRD to show partially strain relaxed CdTe
* Collect/generate DFT images of Cd and Te energy landscapes on sapphire

Science Todos
========================
* Measure and plot narrowness of CdTe peaks before/after liftoff
* Still need to measure and plot HRXRD of pre/post liftoff
* Consider how STEM work on CdTe will be integrated
