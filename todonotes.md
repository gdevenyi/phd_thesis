Writing ToDos
======================
* Generate photograph of InSb liftoff
* TEM/STEM of CdTe for liftoff section
* HRXRD to show partially strain relaxed CdTe
* Generate model of gold on spinel substrate
* Generate model of CdTe on sapphire substrate
* Generate model of InSb on sapphire substrate
* Collect/generate DFT images of Cd and Te energy landscapes on sapphire
* Generate DFT images of InSb on Sapphire substate
* Generate 211 sideview (110) of silicon

* Integrate details of polarity measurement of CdTe
* Fix introduction to talk about SiGe mixed materials
* Include figure page 773 from ohring liftoff cdte
* Surface reconsturctions are charge-neutral

A model of A on B crystal growth, through the examination of geometric/chemical alignment.
- Complications due to nucleation (multiple geometric orientations)
- Sub/superlattice alignment
- The two level model of geometry (symmetry) and energy (bonding)
- first model exists (Graphoepitaxy)
- second model exists (traditional homoepitaxy)

Science Todos
========================
* Measure and plot narrowness of CdTe peaks before/after liftoff
* Still need to measure and plot HRXRD of pre/post liftoff
* Consider how STEM work on CdTe will be integrated


Structure Todos
====================
* \protect all citations in \captions
* Cite Vicky's ray paper somewhere
* Read all references for errors/typos
* Change epi-taxy in intro to greek letters
