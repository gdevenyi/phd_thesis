Figure Corrections
======================
* Edit 211 pole figure to be wide instead of narrow
* Get toppled nanowire figure to include
* Get photograph images from poster to show liftoff
* Generate photograph of InSb liftoff
* Generate pole figure of InSb liftoff
* TEM/STEM of CdTe for liftoff section
* HRXRD to show partially strain relaxed CdTe

Measure and plot narrowness of CdTe peaks before/after liftoff
Still need to measure and plot HRXRD of pre/post liftoff


A model of A on B crystal growth, through the examination of geometric/chemical alignment.
- Complications due to nucleation (multiple geometric orientations)
- Sub/superlattice alignment
