* Surface reconsturctions are charge-neutral

A model of A on B crystal growth, through the examination of geometric/chemical alignment.
- Complications due to nucleation (multiple geometric orientations)
- Sub/superlattice alignment
- The two level model of geometry (symmetry) and energy (bonding)
- first model exists (Graphoepitaxy)
- second model exists (traditional homoepitaxy)

Science Todos
========================
* Measure and plot narrowness of CdTe peaks before/after liftoff
* Still need to measure and plot HRXRD of pre/post liftoff
* Consider how STEM work on CdTe will be integrated


Structure Todos
====================
* Decide on an implement consistent a) b) c) in text
* Investigate scientific words without hyphenation
* Write short-form captions for TOC
* Download citations/generate for SrTiO3
* \protect all citations in \captions
* Cite Vicky's ray paper somewhere
* Read all references for errors/typos
* Change epi-taxy in intro to greek letters
