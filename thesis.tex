            Epitaxy is a key technological process for the production of thin films and nanostructures for electronic and optoelectronic devices.
            The epitaxial process has been traditionally studied through the lens of lattice-matched and chemically similar material systems, specifically the III-V quaternary material systems.
            This work investigates the role energy and symmetry play at epitaxial interfaces for cases far different than those of typical epitaxy.
            In the realm of energy, the impact of chemically dissimilar epitaxial interfaces was investigated, specifically between semiconductors and oxides, noble metals and oxides, and polar-on-nonpolar epitaxy.
            For symmetry at epitaxial interfaces, the role of symmetry breaking, through surface reconstructions and asymmetric surfaces was investigated.
            Investigations into energy found two key insights: 1) epitaxy is possible between materials which one would expect to be very weakly interacting (gold on oxides) and, 2) epitaxial interfaces, while promoting single crystal growth, can be weakly bonded enough to allow controlled liftoff of single crystal epitaxial thin films.
            Investigations into symmetry at epitaxial interfaces found three key insights: 1) intentional symmetry breaking of the growth substrate through steps can suppress twinning of zincblende thin films, 2) asymmetric (211)-oriented substrates can accommodate strain of mismatched zincblende thin films, and 3) reconstructed oxide substrates can provide unique epitaxial templates for thin films which significantly differ from their bulk lattice.
            The results of this investigation provide a path towards the improvement of epitaxy through the manipulation of symmetry at epitaxial surfaces, and the production of free standing thin films through the epitaxial liftoff process.

    First of all, I must thank my wonderful wife Diana, she has been with me my entire academic career, now eleven years at McMaster. Her love and support has allowed me to pursue my research towards the successful thesis you see before. Our partnership in both life and academics has allowed us to both be more than the sum of our parts.
    
    Second, I must thank my supervisor Dr. John Preston.
    Dr. Preston's careful balance of supervision, providing instruction and guidance when it was needed but also extensive leeway to follow my own ideas and experiments.
    Dr. Preston also provided the funding necessary to undertake new experiments while never worrying about expense.
    His urging to always ``try the experiment'' has driven many surprising discoveries and instilled in me a risk taking attitude to always experiment.
    
    This work, in many senses is a collaboration. Many colleagues participated in conversations, assisted with measurements and provided their unique insights to this work. I make an effort here to name and thank my direct collaborators and those have contributed directly to my work, however this will omit many who have contributed at the lunch table or late nights at the Phoenix. Dr. Robert Hughes, my first collaborator and in many ways my first mentor, gave me the opportunity to contribute early and substantially in the work of the research group, and taught me to recognize publishable units, a skill that has resulted in the production of many articles. My collaborators and colleagues Steffi Woo, Stephen Jovanovic, Dr. Kristoffer Meinander, Vicky Jarvis, Matthew Minnick and Joshua Rideout.
    
    Finally, I must thank my parents. Their loving and encouraging household gave me the opportunities which allowed me to develop my skills and interests and to follow my academic career. Their financial support at the start of my academic career allowed me to avoid burdening myself allowing me to keep my focus on learning.
