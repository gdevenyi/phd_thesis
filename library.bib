	demonstrated the plasmon enhancement of optical absorption in amorphous
	silicon solar cells by using silver nanoparticles. Based on the analysis
	of the higher-order surface plasmon modes, it is shown how spectral
	positions of the surface plasmons affect the plasmonic enhancement
	of thin-film solar cells. By using the predictive 3D modeling, we
	investigate the effect of the higher-order modes on that enhancement.
	Finally, we suggest how to maximize the light trapping and optical

	parameters, which in turn can be used to fine tune the corresponding

	We introduce the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensor
	and describe how its exquisite sensitivity to size, shape and environment
	can be harnessed to detect molecular binding events and changes in
	molecular conformation. We then describe recent progress in three
	areas representing the most significant challenges: pushing sensitivity
	towards the single-molecule detection limit, combining LSPR with
	complementary molecular identification techniques such as surface-enhanced
	Raman spectroscopy, and practical development of sensors and instrumentation
	for routine use and high-throughput detection. This review highlights
	several exceptionally promising research directions and discusses
	how diverse applications of plasmonic nanoparticles can be integrated
	in the near future.},

	laser traps, also called "optical tweezers," on micron-sized dielectric
	spheres in the ray optics regime. This serves as a simple model system
	for describing laser trapping and manipulation of living cells and
	organelles within cells. The gradient and scattering forces are defined
	for beams of complex shape in the ray-optics limit. Forces are calculated
	over the entire cross-section of the sphere using TEM00 and TEM*00
	mode input intensity profiles and spheres of varying index of refraction.
	Strong uniform traps are possible with force variations less than
	a factor of 2 over the sphere cross-section. For a laser power of
	10 mW and a relative index of refraction of 1.2, we compute trapping
	forces as high as approximately 1.2 x 10(-6) dynes in the weakest
	(backward) direction of the gradient trap. It is shown that good
	trapping requires high convergence beams from a high numerical aperture
	objective. A comparison is given of traps made using bright field
	or differential interference contrast optics and phase contrast optics.},

	are the ability to grow high quality single-crystal CdTe and CdZnTe
	layers on p-type Si substrates, to dope the CdTe and CdZnTe controllably,
	both n and p-type, and to make low resistance ohmic front and back
	contacts. EPIR demonstrated the consistent MBE growth of CdTe/Si
	and CdZnTe/Si having high crystalline quality despite very large
	lattice mismatches; epitaxial CdTe/Si and CdZnTe/Si consistently
	showed state-of-the-art electron mobilities and good hole mobilities;
	bulk minority carrier recombination lifetimes of unintentionally
	p-doped CdTe and CdZnTe grown by MBE on Si were demonstrated to be
	consistently of order 100 ns or longer; desired n- and p-doping levels
	were achieved; solar cell series specific resistances <10 $\Omega$-cm2
	were achieved; A single-junction solar cell having a state-of-the-art
	value of Voc and a unverified 16.4\% efficiency was fabricated from
	CdZnTe having a 1.80 eV bandgap, ideal for the top junction in a
	tandem cell with a Si bottom junction.},

  abstract = {The invention is comprised of a thin film grown on a substrate, with
	designed-in ability to detach from said substrate upon appropriate
	application of force or energy. This film can either be a single
	material, or a graded/stepped structure. The film is of arbitrary
	thickness. The film is flat on the order of a polished wafer. The
	thin film can be patterned via lithography prior to separation. The
	film after separation is free standing, independent of the growth
	substrate, or bonded to a new carrier substrate for support or electrical
	connection depending on the application. It can be patterned via
	lithography post separation. The original growth substrate is left
	free of film and can be reused for subsequent film growths. The freestanding
	film is separated through application of energy or force to trigger
	the built in separation of the film from a substrate upon which it
	was grown. These include, but are not limited to, mechanical, thermal,
	vibrational, piezoelectric, and optical energies or forces. The growth
	substrate is of any form which allows for the built in ability of
	the film to detach from the substrate. The crystalline nature of
	the film depends upon the presented template from the substrate and
	can range from single crystalline, to amorphous depending on the
	pairing of film material to substrate.},

	complex refractive index. The targets may be isolated entities (e.g.,
	dust particles), but may also be 1-d or 2-d periodic arrays of "target
	unit cells", allowing calculation of absorption, scattering, and
	electric fields around arrays of nanostructures. The theory of the
	DDA and its implementation in DDSCAT is presented in Draine (1988)
	and Draine \& Flatau (1994), and its extension to periodic structures
	(and near-field calculations) in Draine \& Flatau (2008). DDSCAT
	7.1 includes support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math Kernel Library
	(MKL). DDSCAT supports calculations for a variety of target geometries.
	Target materials may be both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. It is
	straightforward for the user to "import" arbitrary target geometries
	into the code. DDSCAT automatically calculates total cross sections
	for absorption and scattering and selected elements of the Mueller
	scattering intensity matrix. This User Guide explains how to use
	DDSCAT 7.1 to carry out electromagnetic scattering calculations.
	DDfield, a Fortran-90 code to calculate E and B at user-selected
	locations near the target, is included in the distribution. A number
	of changes have been made since the last release, DDSCAT 7.0 .},

  abstract = {In this paper following the linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics
	approach, an expression is derived for the calculation of the thermodiffusion
	factor in binary liquid metal alloys. The expression is comprised
	of two terms; the first term accounts for the thermally driven interactions
	between metal ions, a phenomenon similar to that of the non-ionic
	binary mixtures, such as hydrocarbons; the second term is called
	the electronic contribution and is the mass diffusion due to an internal
	electric field that is induced as a result of the imposed thermal
	gradient. Both terms are formulated as functions of the net heats
	of transport. The ion-ion net heat of transport is simulated by the
	activation energy of viscous flow and the electronic net heat of
	transport is correlated with the force acting on the ions by the
	rearrangement of the conduction electrons and ions. A methodology
	is presented and used to estimate the liquid metal properties, such
	as the partial molar internal energies, enthalpies, volumes and the
	activity coefficients used for model validation. The prediction power
	of the proposed expression along with some other existing thermodiffusion
	models for liquid mixtures, such as the Haase, Kempers, Drickamer
	and Firoozabadi formulas are examined against available experimental
	data obtained on ground or in microgravity environment. The proposed
	model satisfactorily predicts the thermodiffusion data of mixtures
	that are composed of elements with comparable melting points. It
	is also potentially and qualitatively able to predict a sign change
	in thermodiffusion factor of Na-K liquid mixture. With some speculation,
	the sign change is attributed to an anomalous change in thermoelectric
	power of Na-K mixture with composition.},

  abstract = {A substrate-based templated assembly route has been devised which
	offers large-area, high-throughput capabilities for the fabrication
	of periodic arrays of sub-micrometer and nanometer-scale structures.
	The approach overcomes a significant technological barrier to the
	widespread use of substrate-based templated assembly by eliminating
	the need for periodic templates having nanoscale features. Instead,
	it relies upon the use of a dynamic template with dimensions that
	evolve in time from easily fabricated micrometer dimensions to those
	on the nanoscale as the assembly process proceeds. The dynamic template
	consists of a pedestal of a sacrificial material, typically antimony,
	upon which an ultrathin layer of a second material is deposited.
	When heated, antimony sublimation results in a continuous reduction
	in template size where the motion of the sublimation fronts direct
	the diffusion of atoms of the second material to a predetermined
	location. The route has broad applicability, having already produced
	periodic arrays of gold, silver, copper, platinum, nickel, cobalt,
	germanium and Au-Ag alloys on substrates as diverse as silicon, sapphire,
	silicon-carbide, graphene and glass. Requiring only modest levels
	of instrumentation, the process provides an enabling route for any
	reasonably equipped researcher to fabricate periodic arrays that
	would otherwise require advanced fabrication facilities.},

	are of high current interest for improving thin film solar cells.
	We demonstrate, by electrodynamics calculations, the feasibility
	of a new class of essentially two dimensional (2D) solar cells based
	on the very large optical cross sections of plasmonic nanoparticles.
	Conditions for inducing absorption in extremely thin PV layers via
	plasmon near-fields, are optimized in 2D-arrays of (i) core-shell
	particles, and (ii) plasmonic particles on planar layers. At the
	plasmon resonance, a pronounced optimum is found for the extinction
	coefficient of the PV material. We also characterize the influence
	of the dielectric environment, PV layer thickness and nanoparticle
	shape, size and spatial distribution. The response of the system
	is close to that of a 2D effective medium layer, and subject to a
	50\% absorption limit when the dielectric environment around the
	2D layer is symmetric. In this case, a plasmon induced absorption
	of about 40\% is demonstrated in PV layers as thin as 10 nm, using
	silver nanoparticle arrays of only 1 nm effective thickness. In an
	asymmetric environment, the useful absorption may be increased significantly
	for the same layer thicknesses. These new types of essentially 2D
	solar cells are concluded to have a large potential for reducing
	solar electricity costs.},

	and growth conditions optimized. The formation of monolayer graphene
	was shown by Raman spectroscopy, optical transmission, grazing incidence
	X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), and low voltage transmission electron
	microscopy (LVTEM). Electrical analysis revealed that a room temperature
	Hall mobility above 2000 cm(2)/V·s was achieved, and the mobility
	and carrier type were correlated to growth conditions. Both GIXRD
	and LVTEM studies confirm a dominant crystal orientation (principally
	graphene [10-10] || sapphire [11-20]) for about 80-90\% of the material
	concomitant with epitaxial growth. The initial phase of the nucleation
	and the lateral growth from the nucleation seeds were observed using
	atomic force microscopy. The initial nuclei density was \~{}24 $\mu$m(-2),
	and a lateral growth rate of \~{}82 nm/min was determined. Density
	functional theory calculations reveal that the binding between graphene
	and sapphire is dominated by weak dispersion interactions and indicate
	that the epitaxial relation as observed by GIXRD is due to preferential
	binding of small molecules on sapphire during early stages of graphene
	formation.},

	We map out the global phase diagram as a function of substrate-adsorbate
	misfit and interaction. This phase diagram reveals all the phases
	corresponding to different well-known growth modes. In particular,
	for large enough misfits and attractive substrate there is a Stranski-Krastanow
	regime, where nano-sized islands grow on top of wetting films. We
	analyze the various terms contributing to the total island energy
	in detail, and show how the competition between them leads to the
	optimal shape and size of the islands. Finally, we also develop an
	analytic interpolation formula for the various contributions to the
	total energy of strained nanoislands.},

	However, unlike H3K4 and H3K9 methylation, the role of H4K20 monomethylation
	(H4K20me-1) in transcriptional regulation remains unclear. Here,
	we show that Wnt3a specifically stimulates H4K20 monomethylation
	at the T cell factor (TCF)-binding element through the histone methylase
	SET8. Additionally, SET8 is crucial for activation of the Wnt reporter
	gene and target genes in both mammalian cells and zebrafish. Furthermore,
	SET8 interacts with lymphoid enhancing factor-1 (LEF1)/TCF4 directly,
	and this interaction is regulated by Wnt3a. Therefore, we conclude
	that SET8 is a Wnt signaling mediator and is recruited by LEF1/TCF4
	to regulate the transcription of Wnt-activated genes, possibly through
	H4K20 monomethylation at the target gene promoters. Our findings
	also indicate that H4K20me-1 is a marker for gene transcription activation,
	at least in canonical Wnt signaling.},

	plasmonic nanostructure typically scatters with a strong angular
	and modal dependence, resulting in significant variations in the

	dependent radiation patterns arising from an individual plasmonic
	nanoparticle, positioned on a dielectric substrate, affect the detection
	of its plasmon modes. Careful consideration of excitation and collection

  abstract = {Previously we have described the deposition of vertically aligned
	wurtzite CdTe nanowires derived from an unusual catalytically driven
	growth mode. This growth mode could only proceed when the surface
	of the substrate was corrupted with an alcohol layer, although the
	role of the corruption was not fully understood. Here, we present
	a study detailing the remarkable role that this substrate surface
	alteration plays in the development of CdTe nanowires; it dramatically
	improves the size uniformity and largely eliminates lateral growth.
	These effects are demonstrated to arise from the altered surface's
	ability to limit Ostwald ripening of the catalytic seed material
	and by providing a surface unable to promote the epitaxial relationship
	needed to sustain a lateral growth mode. The axial growth of the
	CdTe nanowires is found to be exclusively driven through the direct
	impingement of adatoms onto the catalytic seeds leading to a self-limiting
	wire height associated with the sublimation of material from the
	sidewall facets. The work presented furthers the development of the
	mechanisms needed to promote high quality substrate-based vertically
	aligned CdTe nanowires. With our present understanding of the growth
	mechanism being a combination of selective area epitaxy and a catalytically
	driven vapour-liquid-solid growth mode, these results also raise
	the intriguing possibility of employing this growth mode in other
	material systems in an effort to produce superior nanowires.},

  annote = {Our main objective in this tutorial review is to provide insight
	into some of the questions surrounding single molecule detection
	(SMD) using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and surface-enhanced
	resonance Raman scattering (SERRS). Discovered thirty years ago,
	SERS is now a powerful analytical tool, strongly tied to plasmonics,
	a field that encompasses and profits from the optical enhancement
	found in nanostructures that support localized plasmon excitations.
	The spectrum of the single molecule carries the quantum fingerprints
	of the system modulated by the molecule-nanostructure interactions
	and the electronic resonances that may result under laser excitation.
	This information is embedded in vibrational band parameters. The
	dynamics and the molecular environment will affect the bandwidth
	of the observed Raman bands. In addition, the localized surface plasmon
	resonances (LSPR) empower the nanostructure with a number of optical
	properties that will also leave their mark on the observed inelastic
	scattering process. Therefore, controlling size, shape and the formation
	of the aggregation state (or fractality) of certain metallic nanostructures
	becomes a main task for experimental SERS/SERRS. This molecule-nanostructure
	coupling may, inevitably, lead to spectral fluctuations, increase
	photobleaching or photochemistry. An attempt is made here to guide
	the interpretation of this wealth of information when approaching
	the single molecule regime.},

  abstract = {This work presents a detailed analysis of a new two-layer process
	to contact industrial solar cells. However, most of the results seem
	to be transferable to standard screen print paste contacts. The seed
	layer was created by a pad or screen printer and thickened by light-induced
	plating (LIP) of silver. These contact structures were investigated
	microscopically to gain a better understanding of the observed electrical
	parameters. A review of the present microscopic contact formation
	model for flat surfaces is presented. This model was extended and
	applied to surfaces textured with random pyramids. This analysis
	has revealed two new types of silver crystallites which can be described
	by a crystallographic model. The dependence of the silver crystallite
	density on the surface doping concentration was investigated. Next,
	the dependence of the contact resistance on the width of the seed
	layer was measured showing that the contact resistivity increases
	with a reduction of the seed layer width. These results have been
	further approved by an analysis of SEM images of wet-chemically etched
	contacts examining the density of crystallites and the fraction of
	removed SiNx layer. Contact resistance RC measurements before and
	after LIP of silver showed surprisingly a positive influence of the
	plating process on RC. A detailed microscopical analysis revealed
	four new possible current flow paths due to the LIP of a conventional
	contact or a seed layer. The results led to an extension of the existing
	model for a screen-printed contact. Copyright � 2008 John Wiley \&

	nanoprisms. Strong spatial field variation on lengths scales as short
	as 20 nm are observed sensitively depending on structural details
	and environment. The poles of the dipole and quadrupole plasmon modes,
	as identified by phase-sensitive probing and calculations performed
	in the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), reflect the particle
	symmetry. Together with the observation that the largest enhancement
	is not necessarily found to be associated with the tips of the nanoprisms,
	our results provide critical information for the selection of particle
	geometries as building blocks for plasmonic device applications.},

	and a general thickness between 20 and 40nm over a range of several
	$\mu$m were repeatedly prepared and analyzed by Cs-corrected STEM

	preparation of a working thin film solar cell device to a final thickness
	of 10 to 20nm over $\mu$m sized areas in the region of interest,
	enabling atomic resolution imaging and elemental mapping across general

	crucial, yet not fully understood, step for obtaining high efficiency
	organic solar cells. Recent theoretical work suggested an influence
	of polymer conjugation length and of interfacial dipoles on the exciton
	dissociation yield. This necessitates experimental verification.
	To this end, we measured the dissociation yield of several polymer/C60
	planar heterojunction solar cells up to high electric fields. The
	results indeed prove that the yield of exciton dissociation depends
	strongly on the conjugation length of the polymers. Complementary
	photoemission experiments were carried out to assess the importance
	of dipoles at the donor-acceptor interfaces. Comparison of exciton
	dissociation models with experimental data shows that the widely
	used Onsager-Braun approach is unsuitable to explain photodissociation
	in polymer/C60 cells. Better agreement can be obtained using “effective
	mass” models that incorporate conjugation length effects by considering
	a reduced effective mass of the hole on the polymer and that include
	dielectric screening effects by interfacial dipoles. However, successful
	modeling of the photocurrent field dependence over a broad field
	range, in particular for less efficient solar cell compounds, requires
	that the dissociation at localized acceptor sites is also taken into
	account.},

  abstract = {We have carried out computational density functional investigations
	of Co I Re J (J=0,1,2; I+J=14) metal atom clusters. Through thorough
	optimization of geometry, spin polarization, and electronic configuration,
	the most stable structures for each cluster have been identified.
	While the global minima are found to be well defined and energetically
	well separated from other local minima, the study reveals a plethora
	of different structures and symmetries only moderately higher in
	energy. A key point of interest is the effect of doping the cobalt
	clusters with rhenium. Aside from significant structural reorganizations,
	rhenium is found to stabilize the clusters and couple down the spin.
	Furthermore, the most stable clusters comprise highly coordinated
	rhenium and, in the case of Co 12 Re 2, Re-Re bonding. Our results
	are compared to earlier experimental and computational data.},

  annote = {Vesicles consisting of a bilayer membrane of amphiphilic lipid molecules
	are remarkably flexible surfaces that show an amazing variety of
	shapes of different symmetry and topology. Owing to the fluidity
	of the membrane, shape transitions such as budding can be induced
	by temperature changes or the action of optical tweezers. Thermally
	excited shape fluctuations are both strong and slow enough to be
	visible by video microscopy. Depending on the physical conditions,
	vesicles adhere to and unbind from each other or a substrate. This
	article describes the systematic physical theory developed to understand
	the static and dynamic aspects of membrane and vesicle configurations.
	The preferred shapes arise from a competition between curvature energy,
	which derives from the bending elasticity of the membrane, geometrical
	constraints such as fixed surface area and fixed enclosed volume,
	and a signature of the bilayer aspect. These shapes of lowest energy
	are arranged into phase diagrams, which separate regions of different
	symmetry by continuous or discontinuous transitions. The geometrical
	constraints affect the fluctuations around these shapes by creating
	an effective tension. For vesicles of non-spherical topology, the
	conformal invariance of the curvature energy leads to conformal diffusion,
	which signifies a one-fold degeneracy of the ground state. Unbinding
	and adhesion transitions arise from the balance between attractive
	interactions and entropic repulsion or a cost in bending energy,
	respectively. Both the dynamics of equilibrium fluctuations and the
	dynamics of shape transformations are governed not only by viscous
	damping in the surrounding liquid but also by internal friction if
	the two monolayers slip over each other. More complex membranes such
	as that of the red blood cell exhibit a variety of new phenomena
	because of coupling between internal degrees of freedom and external
	geometry.},

  abstract = {The plasmonic properties of single silver triangular nanoprisms are
	investigated using dark-field optical microscopy and spectroscopy.
	Two distinct localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) are observed.
	These are assigned as in-plane dipolar and quadrupolar plasmon excitations
	using electrodynamic modeling based on the discrete dipole approximation
	(DDA). The dipole resonance is found to be very intense, and its
	peak wavelength is extremely sensitive to the height, edge length,
	and tip sharpness of the triangular nanoprism. In contrast, the intensity
	of the quadrupole resonance is much weaker relative to the dipole
	resonance in the single particle spectra than in the ensemble averaged
	spectrum. Several parameters relevant to the chemical sensing properties
	of these nanoprisms have been measured. The dependence of the dipole
	plasmon resonance on the refractive index of the external medium
	is found to be as high as 205 nm RIU(-1) and the plasmon line width
	as narrow as approximately 0.17 eV. These data lead to a sensing
	figure of merit (FOM), the slope of refractive index sensitivity
	in eV RIU(-1)/line width (eV), as high as 3.3. In addition, the LSPR
	shift response to alkanethiol chain length was found to be linear
	with a slope of 4.4 nm per CH2 unit. This is the highest short-range
	refractive index sensitivity yet measured for a nanoparticle.},

  abstract = {Nanoparticles are capable of both enhancing and suppressing the photocurrent
	in a silicon diode when deposited on the active face of the device.
	Photocurrent imaging of the individual nanoparticles and nanoparticle
	aggregates responsible for this effect reveals that Au nanospheres,
	nanoshells, and nanoshell dimers each exhibit unique wavelength-dependent
	suppression-enhancement characteristics. In contrast, silica nanospheres
	provide a sizable and relatively uniform photocurrent enhancement
	across the same spectral range (532-980 nm). Unusual light-harvesting
	behavior observed correlates with a highly complex energy flow (optical
	"vortexing") for the forward scattered light of plasmon resonant
	nanoparticles into the device.},

	of the legs of the tripods within a substrate, is attributed to the
	van der Waals interaction between the tripod bases and the mica surface,
	instead of to the covalent chemical bond which would require lattice
	matching between the epilayer and the substrate. The results demonstrated

	ordered arrays of more complex nanoarchitectures from various classes

  abstract = {Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectroscopy of metallic
	nanoparticles is a powerful technique for chemical and biological
	sensing experiments. Moreover, the LSPR is responsible for the electromagnetic-field
	enhancement that leads to surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
	and other surface-enhanced spectroscopic processes. This review describes
	recent fundamental spectroscopic studies that reveal key relationships
	governing the LSPR spectral location and its sensitivity to the local
	environment, including nanoparticle shape and size. We also describe
	studies on the distance dependence of the enhanced electromagnetic
	field and the relationship between the plasmon resonance and the
	Raman excitation energy. Lastly, we introduce a new form of LSPR
	spectroscopy, involving the coupling between nanoparticle plasmon
	resonances and adsorbate molecular resonances. The results from these
	fundamental studies guide the design of new sensing experiments,
	illustrated through applications in which researchers use both LSPR
	wavelength-shift sensing and SERS to detect molecules of chemical
	and biological relevance.},

	SHAPE MEMORY THIN FILMS}},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {The purpose of this work was to develop a growth pathway for synthesis
	of high-quality ferromagnetic Ni-Mn-Ga shape memory thin films and
	to understand their functional properties. Two groups of Ni-Mn-Ga
	films were prepared using the pulsed laser deposition technique.
	One group was grown on (100) YSZ ((Zr,Y)O2 with ZrO2:Y2O2=92:8) and
	was used to study the thermal, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties.
	The other group was deposited on (100) MgO. These films were fabricated
	into free-standing micro-bridges. These Ni-Mn-Ga films were synthesized
	in a previously unexplored high temperature deposition regime. The
	temperatures employed encouraged the development of the desired micrometer-size
	highly twinned martensitic grain structure while the general problem
	of preferential evaporation of the volatile elements at elevated
	temperatures was solved by using a manganese and gallium enriched
	target. The films grown on (100) YSZ exhibit a self-reversible, magnetically
	induced reorientation of the martensite variants (MIR), which is
	temperature dependent. The mechanism iii associated with the self-activated
	reversibility in the MIR effect was established through a detailed
	characterization of the texture, microstructure, and magnetic domain
	structure of the films. The synthesized films also show a large magnetocaloric
	effect (MCE), which is particularly strong at low magnetic fields.
	The effect is associated with an overlapped secondorder ferromagnetic
	and first-order martensitic phase transition. Detailed characterization
	of these transitions allow for an understanding of the role each
	phase transition plays in determining the level of enhancement to
	a standard MCE governed only by the second-order ferromagnetic phase
	transition. Ni-Mn-Ga free-standing micro-bridges were fabricated
	using photolithography followed by wet chemical etching. Microstructural
	evolution of the martensitic variants resulting from changes to the
	stress field in the detached areas was studied in the context of
	potential film applications for micro-actuators.},
