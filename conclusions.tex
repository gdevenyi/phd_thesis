The investigations presented here have provided insight into a number of corner cases of epitaxy. In this work, two themes outside the usual epitaxial process were examined, unusual symmetry relationships and unusual energy relationships between the host substrate and the epitaxial crystal. Examinations of symmetry involved epitaxy of systems where the 2D symmetry net is preserved over the interface, while the two crystals themselves have different symmetries or where symmetry is broken across the interface. Examinations of unusual energy relationships involved polar on non-polar epitaxy of face-centred cubic semiconductors as well as epitaxial growth on oxide substrates.
