abstract = {A class of nanostructured surface phases on SrTiO3(001) is reported and characterized through atomic-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy. These surface phases are created via argon ion sputtering and UHV annealing and form close-packed domains of highly ordered nanostructures. Depending on the type of nanostructures present, the domain ordering exhibit either (6 x 2), (9 x 2), (12 x 2), (6 x 8), or (7 x 4) surface patterning. The nanostructures are composed of TiO2-derived complexes surrounded by a TiO2 surface termination. Such surface ordering phenomena introduce another level of complexity in the chemistry of perovskite oxide surfaces and provide a basis from which potential photocatalytic and molecular-ordering applications may be developed.},

@article{Ohtomo2004,
abstract = {Polarity discontinuities at the interfaces between different crystalline materials (heterointerfaces) can lead to nontrivial local atomic and electronic structure, owing to the presence of dangling bonds and incomplete atomic coordinations. These discontinuities often arise in naturally layered oxide structures, such as the superconducting copper oxides and ferroelectric titanates, as well as in artificial thin film oxide heterostructures such as manganite tunnel junctions. If polarity discontinuities can be atomically controlled, unusual charge states that are inaccessible in bulk materials could be realized. Here we have examined a model interface between two insulating perovskite oxides--LaAlO3 and SrTiO3--in which we control the termination layer at the interface on an atomic scale. In the simple ionic limit, this interface presents an extra half electron or hole per two-dimensional unit cell, depending on the structure of the interface. The hole-doped interface is found to be insulating, whereas the electron-doped interface is conducting, with extremely high carrier mobility exceeding 10,000 cm2 V(-1) s(-1). At low temperature, dramatic magnetoresistance oscillations periodic with the inverse magnetic field are observed, indicating quantum transport. These results present a broad opportunity to tailor low-dimensional charge states by atomically engineered oxide heteroepitaxy.},

abstract = {Oxide surfaces are important for applications in catalysis and thin film growth. An important frontier in solid-state inorganic chemistry is the prediction of the surface structure of an oxide. Comparatively little is known about atomic arrangements at oxide surfaces at present, and there has been considerable discussion concerning the forces that control such arrangements. For instance, one model suggests that the dominant factor is a reduction of Coulomb forces; another favours minimization of 'dangling bonds' by charge transfer to states below the Fermi energy. The surface structure and properties of SrTiO(3)--a standard model for oxides with a perovskite structure--have been studied extensively. Here we report a solution of the 2 x 1 SrTiO(3) (001) surface structure obtained through a combination of high-resolution electron microscopy and theoretical direct methods. Our results indicate that surface rearrangement of TiO(6-x) units into edge-sharing blocks determines the SrO-deficient surface structure of SrTiO(3). We suggest that this structural concept can be extended to perovskite surfaces in general.},

The structure is characterized by a single overlayer of TiO(2) stoichiometry in which TiO(5) polyhedra are arranged into edge-shared structures, in contrast to the corner-shared TiO(6) polyhedra in bulk. This structural pattern is similar to that reported by us earlier for the (2 x 1) reconstruction of the same crystal face formed at higher temperature. We discuss probable mechanisms of surface stabilization as revealed by these two solutions which are likely to apply to other reconstructions of SrTiO(3) (001) and, possibly, other perovskites in general.},
